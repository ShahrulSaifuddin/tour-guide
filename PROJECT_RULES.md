# Project Rules — “Get Shit Done”

> **Mission Control Rules** for Shahrul Private Tour Guide.

## Core Principles

1.  **Plan Before You Build** — No code without specification.
2.  **State Is Sacred** — Every action updates `STATE.md`.
3.  **Context Is Limited** — Prevent degradation through hygiene.
4.  **Verify Empirically** — No "trust me, it works".

## Workflow Rules

- **Before coding**: Check `SPEC.md` or `implementation_plan.md` is finalized.
- **Before file read**: Search first, then targeted read.
- **After each task**: Update `STATE.md`.
- **After 3 failures**: State dump + fresh session.
- **Before "Done"**: Empirical proof captured.
